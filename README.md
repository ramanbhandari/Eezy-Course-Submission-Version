# Eezy: Personal Manager - *Eezy manage, Eezy life*

## Purpose

Many people have very busy schedules in their day to day lives and in the age of technology, many of us use our phones with different applications to stay organized and keep track of all the tasks we need to get done. However, just like how life can take sudden turns for the worse, our digital organiztion can become scrambled and incoherent through the use of many applications to try to stay organized.

This is where *Eezy* comes in. Our team members have been in this exact situation which became the inspiration for our application. *Eezy* aims to bring together all parts of our digital organization into one, centralized app.

## Running the application

The *Eezy* application is currently in development. To run the application:

- Build in **Android Studio** using **Gradle**
  - > Note: if you have run our application before, make sure to sync the project with the Gradle files as there are many updates in our dependencies/libraries.
- A *Nexus 7* running API 31 is recommended
