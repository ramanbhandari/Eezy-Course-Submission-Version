# Worksheet for Iteration 1
### Feature Story

A feature that was not in our intial Iteration 0 was the Login Page. Although we discussed it we had not thought to actually implement it or create issues to make sure we would complete it. After another feature (a To-do list) was realized to not be possible for the current iteration we were working on, we had to move to creating the login/signup screen. Implementing this feature was interesting as it would have to work with a dummy database. Through trial and error, we decided on a LinkedList of Users to store our data. The feature itself is very important as it will be the first item interacted with when loading into our application. We learned a lot from this iteration and implementing this feature, plans fall through and it is up to us as the team to reevaluate and iterate on what we have already done.

### Exceptional Code
During this iteration of our project, the logic we used for our database was a very simple LinkedList of our object type User. There was not throwing exceptions although we ran a thorough JUnit test through our LinkedList to make sure no exceptions would occur.

### Branching Strategy

### Agile Planning

For this iteration, we had 2 big features and a single user story that we wanted to implement. As time went on, we realized one of our features might have been too big of a project to tackle in the first real iteration of our project. It took time, but our team decided it would be best to move on and work on another feature inplace of it. That feature was then pushed to Iteration 2 along with many other User Stories that we had estimated we could complete. Most features and User Stories from the beginning had good vision so there was no need for us to go back and edit any of the issues we had already created. Although, we did have to add some issues to our repo as we had an idea that was not part of the original ideation stage.
