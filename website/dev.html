        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The design for the architecture for our project was based on the sample project give to the class. We found being able to separate logic, persistence, and presentation to be extremely valuable in that it showed us where we were lacking in detail and what we needed to work on improving. The design also allowed us to stay much more organized since we were able to know where code would go and where to look if errors occured.</p>

        <h1 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> What went right in the development process?&nbsp;</h1>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> For our group, the most valuable part of the development process for us was learning to write, communicate, and create meaningful code among all our group members. At the beginning, this was our biggest flaw, but after Iteration 1, we were able to find a system that allowed us to stay in contact and continue development while keeping everyone informed!</p>

        <h1 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> What went wrong in the development process?</h1>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The most detrimental part of our development process would have been our overall project velocity. While we tried to improve between each iteration, we continued to improperly gauge how much time we would need for certain features and user stories. This lead us to becoming very stagnant during Iteration 2 with no much improvement or growth since Iteration 1. However, during Iteration 3, we have been able to improve this aspect drastically!</p>

        <h1 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</h1>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Starting from our iteration 1 we had issues with our database where we were not able to implement it in the first iteration and due to misunderstands im0lemented a bit wrong in iteration 2. Finally in our iteration our database works perfectly, it took a bit more time than we expected but it was a good learning experience.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> We were fortunately able to deliver most of what we intended to deliver except two features. Initially we were planning on including a basic to-do list to note down any tasks and a financial manager to help keep track of daily expenses. These two features were the ones we were not able to implement.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</h1>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Working with a team setting we learned extensively about importance of communication. In our first iteration our communication within the team wasn't the best and as a consequence our end result wasn't the best either. As the semester progressed our communication was better and we enjoyed having our regular meetings. So we learned that communication is extremely important in a team setting. One thing we need to stop next time around is over estimating how much time we have. After Iteration 2, we decided to try to get started on work earlier rather than leaving issues to later and having to deal with problems close to the deadline. To fix this we wanted to fix our project velocity and work on our time estimates. We did a lot better on this iteration, as a group our communication was much better and we were able to get much more done in the time we had. The database was corrected and the rest of our project grew very quickly after.</p>
